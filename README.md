A DataBase Which Has No Name - DB.

I really want to learn database technology, implements a database by my self.

But every time I want to code, I realize that I don't even know WHAT DATABASE IS.

So, I think I need to learn the database systematically.

This time, I created a repository, not just for coding, but also for documentation and study notes.


## The goal
The goal is to implements a full-featured `RDBMS(Relational Database Management System)`,
like `MySQL`, `MariaDB`.

Of course I cannot implement such industrial database, but that is my ultimate goal.

At the beginning, I will divide the database knowledges onto small region, list them,
and learn them one by one.

Then, use `Rust` language to implement the parts that I already learned.

> Why `Rust`? Because I like it. I heared that `Rust` is very fast, and funny programming language.
I tried to learn it, but I didn't use it, almost everything I learned was forgotten.

## What is the database made of?
I will find some documents, to list them here.
